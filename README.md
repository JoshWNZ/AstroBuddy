## TODO:

- Collate the above information (saved locations, wishlisted targets, saved equipment) into a summary on the homepage
- Use the information to make recommendations to the user on what to image and when
- Allow the user to set custom parameters for what they consider acceptable weather (e.g. some equipment is more sensitive to wind or dew than others)
- Implement functionality to allow the user to define a custom horizon for their imaging location so that any obstructions (trees, buildings, stretlights, etc) can be considered when recommending targets
